# App Store Analytics Export

Scripts for exporting app analytics to BigQuery.
The export will export individual metrics grouped by a single dimension and load each
metric and dimension combination into a single table.
Metrics and dimensions that will be exported can be found in the 
[metric metadata file](analytics_export/tableMetadata.js).

This export uses the 
[iTunesConnectAnalytics](https://github.com/JanHalozan/iTunesConnectAnalytics) package to handle authentication.
A username and password for App Store Connect is required to use the script. 

### Adding Metrics To Export

To add new metrics to export, add an entry to `metricData` in
[`analytics_export/tableMetadata.js`](analytics_export/tableMetadata.js).
The dimensions for the metrics will be automatically detected.

This job exports a table for each metric and dimension combination.
This [script in bigquery-etl](https://github.com/mozilla/bigquery-etl/blob/master/script/marketing/generate_app_store_queries.py)
generates sql that combines all the metrics by dimension, creating one table per dimension.
The script checks for existing tables in BigQuery so it must be run after the new metrics have been exported at least once.

Official documentation of metrics and dimensions can be found at 
https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/itc21781223f

## Usage

This project uses `yarn` to manage dependencies and was developed with nodejs 12.

To install dependencies use:
```sh
yarn
```

To run the export use `yarn export`.  Use `yarn export --help` to view supported options.

e.g.
```sh
yarn export \
    --username=u \
    --password=p \
    --app-id=123 \
    --app-name=app \
    --start-date=2020-01-01 \
    --project=test-project \
    --dataset=test-dataset
```

ESLint and Prettier are used for code formatting and linting.
Lint check can be run with:
```sh
yarn lint
```
And automatic fixing can be done with:
```sh
yarn lint-fix && yarn pretty
```

Tests are run with mocha:
```sh
